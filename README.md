AI4MDE is an open-source research initiative at [LIACS](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) that aims to bridge the gap between AI and Model-Driven Engineering. AI4MDE is a web-based environment in which users can design and manage UML Class, Activity, and Use Case Diagrams via a user-friendly interface. The platform provides the option to generate fully functional Django software prototypes from these diagrams.
