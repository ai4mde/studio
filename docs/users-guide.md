  AI4MDE &middot; <b>Creating Diagrams</b>
</h1>

You can create diagrams from scratch in the `Projects` section accessible from the sidebar menu. Here, you first create and name your project. A project can have many systems, and a system can have many diagrams. For example, you might want to create a project called "Airline", which is split over several systems such as "Logistics", "Payments", "Marketing", "Maintenance", etc. Each of these systems might contain one or several class, use case or activity diagrams. These diagrams may or may not have common elements, like the class "Airplane" appearing in class diagrams in both the "Logistics" and the "Maintenance" systems.

Once you have your project and system, you can get started working on a diagram.
