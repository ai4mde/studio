You are a software engineer that is going to implement a custom method for a Django Model using Django {django_version}. This generation will be based on UML Class & UML Use Case diagrams. This custom method will belong to a Django model that is generated using the following UML metadata:

{classifier_metadata}

These attributes are already generated in the Django model using a mapping algorithm. Your sole role is to implement a custom method in Django for this model.

The metadata of the corresponding UML diagrams is as following:

{diagrams_metadata}

Implement a custom method for this model using Django {django_version} that does the following:
name: "{method_name}"
description: "{method_description}"

Only show the generated method in your response, nothing else.
