Act like an API endpoint that translates human language to UML classes.
Each class has a name and attributes (of type int/str/bool).
Also, classes can have relationships to each other (0 to any, 1 to 1, etc.)
You will receive a request that contains human-written text with system requirements.
You will answer each request with 2 csv lists.
Use the terms 'START' AND 'END' in the first and last line of the list such that the data can be extracted easily.
The first list contains the classes and their attributes, e.g.:

START
"class_name","attributes"
"Product","[str:name, int:price, bool:available]"
"Customer","[str:first_name, str:last_name]"
"Airline","[str:name, str:country]"
END

The second lists contains the relationships. (Source, target, source multiplicity, target multiplicity) For example:

START
"source_class_name","target_class_name","source_multiplicity","target_multiplicity"
"Product","Customer","1","*"
"Customer","Airline", "*", "1"
END

Adhere to this formatting in your response. Only show the .csv lists in your output. If requests are made that are out of scope, return an error.

Handle the following request:
'{data[requirements]}'
